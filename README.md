# hello-worldd
hey hey
I'm editing readme right now 
But the cool thing is I'm doing it in a 'branch'
which is pretty much a clone of my main file
and the main file stays the same
tho after I code and test and code again in this branch ,and the project is over 
i'll merge it with the master branch ,so my final folder will look goodd
